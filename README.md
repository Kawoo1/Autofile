# Autofile
Autofile is a file sorting program currently in development with the simple task and goal of assisting users with decluttering their desktop, laptop, or personal device. The program takes a source directory, and a destination directory, then runs a script to move all files of the appropriate type into corresponding folders. This is currently a personal project so the folder names are and classifications are catered to personal preference. The source and destination of the program are commented out currently so any unaware user does not use the program and accidentally damage their file systems or device as the development is not complete. 
----------------------------------------- Common Questions --------------------------------------------------------------------
When will it be done?
-Development has only begun and the completion date is TBD
What will it have?
-It will have an interactive and next generation user interface that allows anyone and everyone to simply run the program, pick what they would like to be sorted, where it should be sorted, and to pick the file names (up to 10) for the files themselves! Of course, the user may already rename and adjust any file sortment as they please. This tool is to aid in decluttering the device, it still needs that human touch :)
How much is it?
-This is a personal project, currently published on github. Its free of course!
